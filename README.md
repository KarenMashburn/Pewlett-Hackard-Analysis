# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

## Overview 
Pewlett Hackard requested our help to determine how many employees will be eligable for retirement. 

## Results



* The total number of retiring roles are 133,776.

* Only 1,940 employees quailify for mentorship eligibilty. If they all only mentored 1 person there would still be 131,836 roles that would need to be filled. 

* If they divided evenly that would leave each mentor roughly mentoring 70 people.  Which I don't think would effeicitant or managble.

* There are 6 key titles that have someone eliageible to retire. 


## Summary

There are 131,836 roles that will need to be filled.
There are only 1,940 quilified canidates to provide mentoring. 
There are 6 key titles that will need to be replaced as the "silver tsunami" begins. 
No the amount of people each memtor would have to mentor would be unmanageble. 
Would suggest hiring new canidates or prompting from with in.
